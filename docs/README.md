# Documentation Overview

This directory contains all project documentation organized into logical sections.

## Development Documentation

- **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Core development workflow, contribution guidelines, and security integration
- **[CONTEXT7-INTEGRATION.md](CONTEXT7-INTEGRATION.md)** - Context7 API integration documentation and usage

## Security Documentation

- **[SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md](SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md)** - Security best practices and guidelines for the project
- **[SECURITY_INCIDENT_API_KEY_EXPOSURE.md](SECURITY_INCIDENT_API_KEY_EXPOSURE.md)** - Security incident documentation and response record

## Archived Documentation

- **[archive/](archive/)** - Contains obsolete or completed implementation documentation

### Security Implementation Archive

The `archive/security-implementation/` directory contains historical security implementation documents that were used during the security enhancement process but are no longer needed for ongoing development:

- Security implementation guides
- Security fix plans  
- Security audit reports

These documents are preserved for historical reference but are not part of the active documentation.

## Quick Start

For new contributors:

1. Start with [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the development workflow
2. Review [SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md](SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md) for security requirements
3. Check [CONTEXT7-INTEGRATION.md](CONTEXT7-INTEGRATION.md) for API integration details

## Documentation Maintenance

All documentation should be kept up-to-date with code changes. Security-related changes require special attention to the security guidelines and incident documentation.
