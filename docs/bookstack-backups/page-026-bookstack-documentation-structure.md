## Original markdown

## Overview

This document explains the organizational structure and content placement guidelines for my BookStack knowledge base. This ensures consistency when creating new documentation and helps AI assistants maintain proper organization.

**Instance**: <https://bookstack.deejpotter.com>  
**Platform**: Self-hosted on Orange Pi Zero 3 via Coolify

## Organizational Hierarchy

BookStack uses a three-level hierarchy:

1. **Shelves** - Top-level categories organized by purpose
2. **Books** - Collections of related pages within a shelf
3. **Pages** (& Chapters) - Individual documentation units

## The 5 Shelves

### 1. Projects (Shelf ID: 4)
**Purpose**: Personal software, web applications, and engineering hobby projects

**Current Books**:
- **MCP Server** (ID: 6) - TypeScript Model Context Protocol server
- **deejpotter.com** (ID: 7) - Personal portfolio website (Next.js 13 App Router)

**Future Content**: 3D printing projects, home automation, hardware/engineering hobbies

**When to Use**: Any personal project involving software development, web development, or engineering hobbies

---

### 2. Servers & Infrastructure (Shelf ID: 1)
**Purpose**: Server administration, self-hosted services, networking, and security

**Current Books**:
- **My Pi Server** (ID: 1) - Orange Pi Zero 3 setup, Coolify, Docker, networking

**Future Content**: Security hardening guides, backup strategies, service configurations (Vaultwarden, FreeScout, etc.)

**When to Use**: Server administration tasks, infrastructure setup, networking configuration, security documentation

---

### 3. Development (Shelf ID: 2)
**Purpose**: Personal development preferences, workflows, AI prompts, and coding standards

**Current Books**:
- **Prompts & AI Guides** (ID: 4) - AI assistant workflows, prompt engineering, development guidance

**Future Content**: Coding standards, lessons learned, development processes, tool configurations, Git workflows

**When to Use**: Personal development preferences, AI workflows, coding standards, development tools configuration

---

### 4. Maker Store (Shelf ID: 3)
**Purpose**: Work-related CNC machine documentation (FORTIS Router machines)

**Current Books**:
- **CNC Projects & Product Guidance** (ID: 5) - Customer projects, machine specifications

**Future Content**: Machine troubleshooting, customer solutions, product documentation

**When to Use**: ONLY for work-related Maker Store content. Do NOT mix with personal projects.

---

### 5. Clients (Shelf ID: 5)
**Purpose**: Professional services, contract work, and client project documentation

**Current Status**: Empty, reserved for future use

**Future Content**: Client-specific projects, proposals, technical documentation for professional services

**When to Use**: When taking on professional services work or client contracts

## Content Placement Guidelines

### Decision Tree for New Documentation

1. **Is it work-related to Maker Store?** → Maker Store shelf
2. **Is it a personal software/web/engineering project?** → Projects shelf
3. **Is it about server admin or self-hosted services?** → Servers & Infrastructure shelf
4. **Is it about my development preferences/workflows?** → Development shelf
5. **Is it for a professional client?** → Clients shelf

### Book vs Page Decision

**Create a BOOK when**:
- Topic requires multiple pages or chapters
- Subject is substantial enough to stand alone
- Content will grow over time
- Needs its own table of contents

**Create a PAGE when**:
- Single topic documentation
- Content fits well within existing book
- Adding to established topic area
- Quick reference or guide
