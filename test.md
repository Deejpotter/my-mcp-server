Hi Donovan,

Thanks for your inquiry about CNC Shield bundles with DRV8825 drivers!

I understand you're comparing pricing to AliExpress—that makes total sense. Let me break down what we offer and the value difference.

Great choice on the DRV8825 drivers, by the way! They're excellent for smoother motion and higher current handling (up to 2.5A vs 2A for A4988), plus they offer 1/32 microstepping for really smooth operation.

- Total: ~$62-67 Inc. GST
- Best for: Just need controller electronics, already have power supply & accessories

**Option 3: CNC Shield Bundle Pack** (Budget Option with A4988)

- Arduino Uno + CNC Shield + 4x A4988 drivers

**Pricing Comparison:**
Compared to AliExpress bundles (~$25-40 USD ≈ $38-60 AUD), our options are competitive, and you get:

- ✅ Fast delivery (2-5 days vs 2-8 weeks)
- ✅ Quality-tested components (no DOA surprises)
- ✅ GRBL pre-flashed on Arduino bundles (saves setup time)
- ✅ Technical support for wiring, configuration, and troubleshooting
- ✅ Easy returns if needed (vs international shipping hassle)
- ✅ Embedded DRV8825 option (Maker Shield) - unique to us

Quick questions to help me recommend the best option:

1. Do you already have an Arduino Uno, or do you need one included?
2. What motors are you using—NEMA 17 or NEMA 23?
3. Is this your first CNC electronics build, or have you done this before?
4. How soon do you need these components?

I'm happy to help with:

- Wiring diagrams for your motor configuration
- GRBL configuration and setup
- Microstepping jumper configuration (for standard shield)
- Driver current adjustment for your specific motors
